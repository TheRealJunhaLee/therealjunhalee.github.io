            <h2>Hey, I'm Junha Lee</h2>
            
            <p>
                I'm a programmer who is interested in game design and development. I'm no professional however. I am still learning many of the coding, art and design skills needed to develop commercial games, and the more I learn the more I realize I need to learn.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This website exists to showcase projects I have completed, most of which will be little simulations using html native canvas, or small games I construct in the Unity game engine.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Please take some time to check out the work I have uploaded here, if there is any to show. Thank you for your time.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Experience</h2>
            
            <p>
                As far as experience is concerned, I can't say I have all too much. I can't claim mastery of any of the major programming languages, however, I do have enough experience in a few programming languages to say that I'm proficient. These programming languages are HTML/CSS/JS, Java, and C#.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I do have limited experience in other programming languages, such as c++ and python. I learn languages if I need to learn them, so I don't see myself becoming proficient in those anytime soon, unless I am forced to.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                My experience within the game dev realm is not limited to programming though. Despite the fact that coding is my strongest point, I know how to work with blender for 3D modelling as well as knowing enough pixel art to get me by.
            </p>
